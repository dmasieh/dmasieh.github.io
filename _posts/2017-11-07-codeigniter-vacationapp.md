projName: Alfre-Cation
projTech: CodeIgniter - PHP
projTitle: AlfreCation CodeIgniter-PHP Weather App
desc: Weather application written in the CodeIgniter PHP Framework. Titled "AlfreCation" for the college town that I am/was based out of for my Undergraduate education, Alfred, NY, the purpose of this was to highlight possible "vacation spots" in the area. However, the humor in this is that since this is a small "stranger-things" kinda town, there ain't really any viable places to vacations. So, the Western-New York area will suffice.
